fuse
    fuse some continuous legs into one leg.
    
SYNOPSIS   
    subroutine                 fuse(index1,index2)
    integer                    index1
   integer                     index2
    
PURPOSE
	fuse some continuous legs into one leg. Note if there are names in dimension, the name will be no changes.
	fuse the legs from index1 to index2 into one leg. index1 and index2 are the order of legs. For example there
	is  a Tensor whose dimension is [2,3,4,5,6],T%fuse(2,4) will result a Tensor whose dimension is [2,60,6], the
	second, third and firth legs are fuse into one leg. 

PARAMETERS
   index1        - integer -
                 specify the legs being fuse, these legs are form index1 to index2
   index2        - integer -
                 specify the legs being fuse, these legs are form index1 to index2

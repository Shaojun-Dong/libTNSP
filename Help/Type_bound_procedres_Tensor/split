split
    split the leg that has been fuse into one.
    
SYNOPSIS   
    subroutine split(fuseindex,inde)
    subroutine split()
    integer                    fuseindex
    integer                    inde
    
PURPOSE
   split the leg that has been fuse into one. Split the fuseindex index of the Tensor into n(1),n(2)
   for example a Tensor whose dimension is [2,3,4,5,6],T%fuse(2,4) return a [2,60,6] Tensor. The second
   leg of this Tensor is made up of three legs, they are [3,4,5]. fuseindex specify the leg to be split.
   In the example fuseindex=2. And in this leg, it can be split form the first location, that is inde=1
   split into [3] and [4,5], or form the second location, inde=2, into [3,4] and [5]. If inde is larger
   than rank ,the function will return no change.
	
	If there is no input parameter, all the legs that have been fused will retrun to unfuse. For the example
	above,T%split() will return back to its oringinal dimension, that is [2,3,4,5,6].

   inde           - integer -

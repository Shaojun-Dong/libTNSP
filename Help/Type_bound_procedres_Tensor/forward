forward   (add Tensor as order in 2016.6.13 to be updata)
    permute a leg(or some legs) to the beginning of the Tensor.
    
SYNOPSIS   
    subroutine           forward(index)
    subroutine           forward(indexArray)
    subroutine           forward(CharIndex)
    subroutine           forward(CharIndexArray)
    
    integer              index,indexArray(:)
    character(len=*)     CharIndex,CharIndexArray(:)
    
PURPOSE
	permute a leg(or some legs) to the beginning of the Tensor.
	
	  1. call T%forward(index): put the ith leg to the beginning of the Tensor. For example the dimension of
        T is [2,3,4,5], the dimension of T%forward(2) will be [3,2,4,5].
        
     2. call T%forward(indexArray): put the legs to the beginning of the Tensor,intVec specify the legs. For example the dimension of
        T is [2,3,4,5], the dimension of T%forward((/2,5/)) will be [3,5,2,4].
    
     3. call T%forward(CharIndex): 
         1) if CharIndex is full dimension name, which mean it contains the mark '.' in the name such as 'A.a' or 'Tensor.dimension'
            and so on, T%forward(CharIndex) is that put the leg with name CharIndex to the beginning of the Tensor.For example the dimension of
            T is [2,3,4,5] and name are ['A.a','B.a','A.b','B.b'], the dimension of T%forward('B.a') will be [3,2,4,5] and the name will
            be ['B.a','A.a','A.b','B.b'].
         2) if CharIndex is Tensor name,  which mean it dose not contain the mark '.' in the name such as 'A' or 'Tensor' and so on.
            T%forward(CharIndex) is that put all the legs with the Tensor name called CharIndex to the beginning of the Tensor. For example,
            the dimension of T is [2,3,4,5] and name are ['A.a','B.a','A.b','B.b'], the dimension of T%forward('B') will be [3,5,2,4]
            and the name will be ['B.a','B.b','A.a','A.b'].
            
     4. call T%forward(CharIndexArray): put the legs to the beginning of the Tensor,CharIndexArray specify the legs, it should be full name of dimension,
        which mean it contains the mark '.' in the name such as 'A.a' or 'Tensor.dimension' and so on, For example the dimension of T
        is [2,3,4,5] and name are ['A.a','B.a','A.b','B.b'], the dimension of T%forward((/'B.b','B.a'/)) will be [5,3,2,4] and the name
        will be ['B.b','B.a','A.a','A.b'].

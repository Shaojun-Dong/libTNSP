Dynamic
    Set the Tensor as a Dynamic Tensor.
    
SYNOPSIS   
    
    subroutine Dynamic()
    
PURPOSE
	Set the Tensor as a Dynamic Tensor. If the Tensor is a Dynamic, it can change its type
	accoding to the program. If not, can not change it type. For example, suppose T is a 
	Tensor of integer, T=(/1.1,2.3/), the result will be that the element store in T is
	[1,2] because T is integer. But if T is a Dynamic Tensor, after the code T will change
	its type to real*4 and then store the real*4 data.

  type(Tensor)::T
  call T%setType('integer')
  T=(/1,2,3/)
  call T%print("T is integer")
  
  T=(/4.56,7.891/)
  call T%print("T is integer,the real*4 data change to integer")
  
  call T%Dynamic()
  T=(/4.56,7.891/)
  call T%print("T change its type to real*4")

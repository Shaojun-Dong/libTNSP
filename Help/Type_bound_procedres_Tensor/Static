Static
    Set the Tensor as a Static Tensor.
    
SYNOPSIS   
    
    subroutine Static()
    
PURPOSE
	Set the Tensor as a Static Tensor. If the Tensor is a Dynamic, it can change its type
	accoding to the program. If not, can not change it type. For example, suppose T is a 
	Tensor of integer, T=(/1.1,2.3/), the result will be that the element store in T is
	[1,2] because T is integer. But if T is a Dynamic Tensor, after the code T will change
	its type to real*4 and then store the real*4 data.

  T=(/1,2,3/)
  call T%print("T is integer")
  
  T=(/4.56d0,7.891d0/)
  call T%print("T is real*8 now")
  
  T=(/1,2,3/)
  call T%print("T is integer,before set Static")
  call T%Static()
  T=(/4.56d0,7.891d0/)
  call T%print("T is Static, can not change its type,the input data change the type of T")
